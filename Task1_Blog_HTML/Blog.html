                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Time dilation is a fascinating concept from Einstein's relativity where time slows down 
                    for objects moving very fast or in strong gravity, meaning clocks (and people!) experience time
                    differently depending on their speed or location, a phenomenon seen in high-speed travel 
                    (astronauts age slower) and even in everyday life through our perception of time during intense focus or awe.

                    <strong>What is Time Dilation?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    At its core, time dilation means time isn't absolute; it's 
                    relative to your motion and gravity. 
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><u>Special Relativity (Speed):</u> The faster you move through space, the slower your time passes relative to someone stationary. 
                        To keep the speed of light constant for everyone, space and time must adjust.</li>
                    <li><u>General Relativity (Gravity):</u> Stronger gravitational fields slow down time. Clocks deep in a gravity well tick slower than those 
                        further away, as seen with GPS satellites needing corrections. CSS for styling and layout</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><u>Astronauts:</u> Astronauts on the International Space Station experience slight time dilation,
                         aging a tiny bit less than people on Earth.</li>

                    <li><u>GPS Satellites:</u>Satellites move fast and are in weaker gravity, 
                        so their clocks run faster than Earth clocks; systems must account for this to be accurate.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Time dilation isn't just science fiction; 
                    it's a proven physical reality affecting technology and our daily perception, 
                    showing that time's passage is a flexible, relative experience.
